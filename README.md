# DSA2_Chupacabra-
This repository is for the creation of our DSA II final project.
This project was created using our professor's Rendering Engine.

Chupacabra is a demonstration of our knowledge of c++, game physics, data structures and algorithms that are useful to video game programming. Our team of four designed and programmed this entire project. It includes examples of our knowledge of proper memory allocation, collision detection, collision resolution, oct trees and spacial optimization.

The game itself involves fleeing advancing Chupacabras down a canyon on the back of your precious pet goat. Fling objects behind you to knock the Chups back and escape for as long as you can!
