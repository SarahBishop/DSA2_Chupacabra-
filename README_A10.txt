A10 - Bounding Object Manager
Team Sucks Goats

Bishop, Sarah - Implemented manager functions to objects
Connick, Ben - Got all collisions to function properly
Gerchman, Alec - Initial setup and extra credit
Stivala, Eric - Set up singleton and manager class

Extra Credit:

For this homework assignment, we decided to implement a different collision resolution than simply changing the color.
Since the placement of the two objects were controlled by vector3s and the movement of Steve was determined by his vector3, it was simply a matter of altering the AppClassControls class so that if the objects were colliding, Steve would move 1 unit backwards while the Creeper would move 1 unit in the direction Steve was initially moving.
We think we deserve these points because we thought it would be a good idea to get started in how to implement collision resolution as our group project depends on objects colliding and bouncing into each other.
